## Welcome!

### What is this class about?
- Learn to manage, transform, and visualize data using the R programming language  
- Organize messy data, transform it in ways that address your questions, and communicate results  
- Can you turn a computer on? Use a mouse? *No programming experience required*  

## Why are you doing this?

> **Want to Make it as a Biologist? Better Learn to Code**  
> "In biology, big data is the thing. Every day, biologists go into the lab to coax data out of living matterâ€”more and more data, with the advent of biological tools like Crispr/Cas9..."We cannot manually look through 15,000 data points anymore," Udeshi says. To analyze it all, biologists need to write programs specifically tailored for their experiments."

## Will it hurt?

- At first, yup
- Learning a new "language" is hard and takes practice
- I am here to guide you, but I won't have all the answers
- We are a community of learners and will help each other
